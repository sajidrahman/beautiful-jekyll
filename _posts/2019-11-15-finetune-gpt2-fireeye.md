Super excited to see my summer research getting featured on [FireEye blog](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/11/combatting-social-media-information-operations-neural-language-models.html)  🔥👁 🦄 

 **TL;DR:** We have demonstrated that large-scale, pre-trained language models are *double-edged sword* ⚔️ : they can be fine-tuned to be fluent in <u>**generating synthetic social media disinformation**</u>, but they could be effectively <u>**operationalized to detect disinformation**</u> as well ⚔️ ⚔️  

Our experiment also sheds light on future internet safety and security, specially on tackling disinformation and FireEye’s role in thwarting these threats 🛡🛡 

Hope you'll enjoy reading the article, and don't forget to share 😊
