As I have started to learn and practice Machine learning concepts and models, I'll jot down important concepts/implementations/paper/tutorial which I find useful.

1. [Overview of Activation Function](https://medium.com/@srnghn/deep-learning-overview-of-neurons-and-activation-functions-1d98286cf1e4)
2. Following is a mind map of ML algorithms, collected from [Jason Brownlee's tutorial](https://machinelearningmastery.com/)
