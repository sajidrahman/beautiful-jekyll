### my history

Before moving to the beautiful campus of [UF](http://virtualtour.ufl.edu/), I was in Manhattan, Kansas, pursuing my MS in [Kansas State University](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Eugene Vasserman](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~eyv/). My MS work was on *text mining in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) dataset* to explore the challenges of software developers utilizing _security related featured_ while coding. Here's a link to my report: [An Empirical Case Study on Stack Overflow to Explore Developersâ€™ Security Challenges](http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/34563).
