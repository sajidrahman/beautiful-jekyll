title: About me
---

Hi, My name is Sajidur Rahman, friends and acquaintances call me _'Sajid'_ (pronounced as 'SA-ZID'). Currently, I am working in
[Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research](http://fics.institute.ufl.edu/) as a graduate research assistant
under the supervision of [Prof. Daniela Oliveira](http://www.daniela.ece.ufl.edu/Home.html).
My research work intersects following cross-cutting areas:

- Usable Security & Privacy Design
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Software Engineering
- Social Computing

Currently, I am investigating the following topics:
1. Exploring software developers’ blind spots while using security-critical APIs in strongly and loosely typed programming languages and
2. Designing developer-centric security tools to illuminate
API blind spots.

### A brief history of myself

Before moving to [UF](http://virtualtour.ufl.edu/), I was in Manhattan, Kansas, pursuing Masters in [Computer Science at Kansas State University](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/) under supervision of [Prof. Eugene Vasserman](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~eyv/).
My MS project was on **text mining in Stack Overflow dataset to explore the challenges of software developers utilizing _security-related features_ while programming**.

Before joining M.S. program, I had been working as a Software Engineer for 3.5+ years. During this period, I was involved in various types of critical projects: from developing centralized MIS system for a large bank to architecting and implementing a core payment engine for a startup fintech company, [SureCash](http://surecash.net/), which has now become [one of the largest mobile payment processors in Bangladesh](https://futurestartup.com/2017/02/11/surecash-101-how-surecash-is-planning-to-become-the-leading-mobile-payment-platform-in-bangladesh/).
