---

Hi, My name is Sajidur Rahman, friends and acquaintances call me _'Sajid'_ (pronounced as 'SA-ZID'). Currently, I am working in
[Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research](http://fics.institute.ufl.edu/) as a graduate research assistant
under the supervision of [Dr. Daniela Oliveira](http://www.daniela.ece.ufl.edu/Home.html).
My research work intersects following cross-cutting areas:

- Security & Privacy Design
- Human-Computer Interaction
- Software Engineering
- Social Computing


### A brief history of myself

Before moving to the beautiful campus of [UF](http://virtualtour.ufl.edu/), I was in Manhattan, Kansas, pursuing my MS in [Computer Science at Kansas State University](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Eugene Vasserman](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~eyv/).
My MS project was on **text mining in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) dataset to explore the challenges of software developers utilizing _security-related features_ while programming**. Here's a link to my report: [An Empirical Case Study on Stack Overflow to Explore Developersâ€™ Security Challenges](http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/34563).
