title: About me
---

Hi, My name is Sajidur Rahman, friends and acquaintances call me _'Sajid'_ (pronounced as 'SA-ZID'). I am a PhD Student at University of Florida 🐊 (one & only Gator Nation). I work at
[Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research](http://fics.institute.ufl.edu/) as a graduate research assistant.
<!--under the supervision of [Prof. Daniela Oliveira](http://www.daniela.ece.ufl.edu/Home.html). -->
My research work intersects following cross-cutting areas:
<!--- Usable Security & Privacy Design - Human-Computer Interaction -->

- Software Security
- Deep Learning/NLP
- Human-centered Computing

<!--- Currently, I am investigating the following topics: -->

<!-- Exploring software developers’ blind spots while using security-critical APIs in strongly and loosely typed programming languages and -->

<!--Designing developer-centric security tools to illuminate
API blind spots. -->

### <!---A brief history of myself -->

<!---Before moving to [UF](http://virtualtour.ufl.edu/), I was in Manhattan, Kansas, pursuing Masters in [Computer Science at Kansas State University](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/) under supervision of [Prof. Eugene Vasserman](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~eyv/).
My MS project was on **text mining in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) dataset to explore the challenges of software developers utilizing _security-related features_ while programming**. Here's a link to my report: [An Empirical Case Study on Stack Overflow to Explore Developers’ Security Challenges](http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/34563). Before I started my Masters, I had been working as Software Engineer for 3+ years. During this period, I was involved in various types of critical projects: from developing centralized MIS system for a large bank to architecting and implementing a core payment engine for a startup fintech company, [SureCash](http://surecash.net/), which has now become [one of the largest mobile payment processors in Bangladesh](https://futurestartup.com/2017/02/11/surecash-101-how-surecash-is-planning-to-become-the-leading-mobile-payment-platform-in-bangladesh/).  -->
